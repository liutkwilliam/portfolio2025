Hello. My name is William. Thank you for browsing my portfolio.

# What is Hugo?

**Hugo** is an open-source static site generator (SSG) written in Go. It is designed for speed, simplicity, and flexibility, making it ideal for blogs, portfolios, documentation sites, and business websites.

Key Features:

- Lightning-fast: Generates entire websites in milliseconds.
- Markdown-based: Write content easily using Markdown.
- Theming & Customization: Supports pre-built themes and custom layouts.
- SCSS/SASS Support (in Hugo Extended).
- Built-in SEO & Multilingual support.
- Easy Deployment: Works with GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.

Hugo is great for developers, writers, and businesses looking for a high-performance, secure, and easy-to-maintain website.

# So why am I using it?

Well, just to explore something new. I used another SSG **Jekyll** when I built a website for an university student society and then my first creative portfolio. Usinh Hugo allows me to discover new techologies and enhance my knowledge base.
