This is a second post with a test to include an image.

Running on nearly no sleep, but waking up early to catch the sunrise at 05:59 along the Bondi coastal walk in late October 2024 was worth every moment. For the first time in months, I finally felt a sense of calm, DSLR camera in hand, capturing the beauty around me. Watching the sun rise over the sea level, surrounded by stunning sculptures, was a fleeting yet much-needed moment of peace amidst the chaos. üåÖ‚ú®Ô∏è
