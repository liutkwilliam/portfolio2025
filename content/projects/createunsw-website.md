William revamped the layout and colour scheme of the UNSW Student club CREATE UNSW in 2019, with applying his creative design and website development skills in HTML, CSS and Jekyll Scripting.

The website revamping is initially launched in February 2019, then the latest version is completed in June 2020.

The website is supported by Lessa Dang in 2019, and Jack Robbers in 2020 for the javascript components.

### Features of the new website design launched in February 2019

*   Consistent design across the website interface<
*   New images from the CREATE events.
*   Portfolio-styled project page to see all our projects on one page.
*   Search and filter functions in the Store Page (CREATE Online Store).
