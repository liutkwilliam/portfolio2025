# Portfolio 2025

This portfolio is currently under development, powered by [Hugo - Static Site Generator](https://gohugo.io/). The portfolio will feature my creative work in design, coding and photography projects.

# Features

At the moment, using a Hugo Theme - [PaperMod](https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/), the website features pages filtering based on the contents' tags and categories.

# Instalation

1. Follow the Quick start - Prerequisites from [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) to install Hugo and [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
2. Open **Git Bash**, type `hugo version` to verify that you have installed Hugo.
3. Clone this repository and open your preferred code editor. I use [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
4. In the code editor, open a new terminal (or using **Git Bash**), navigate to the root of the repository folder that you have cloned.
5. Type `hugo server` to test locally, follow the instructions to open the localhost on your favourite browser.
